      "Some of the works included without priority are new establishments the activities of which are uncertain; some of them would doubtless rank for inclusion in one of the four priority groups if full information were available.\n",
      "In allotting priorities account has been taken of the damage inflicted in area attack only in cases where the productivity of the factory concerned appears to have been permanently affected. In other cases factories are assessed on the basis that they have been fully repaired and are fully active. Owing to the speed with which repairs are put in nand in Borne cases, it did not seem practicable to give weight to damage which may prove to be temporary in assessing priorities which are intended for long-term reference.\n",
      "The priority rating of a factory in the Bomber's Baedeker consequently does not neoessarily reflect its current importance and should not be used for the purpose of appreciations without reference to its current damage status. If the demand from users justifies it, however, periodical statements can be issued to show the current status of damaged factories as well as other amendments.\n",

      "industrial and manufacturing city on the Continent of Europe,\n",
      "The suburbs and built-up area extends from East to nest for some 20 miles, and from North to South approximately 17 miles. The administrative boundaries have been extended by the inclusion of surrounding districts to give a total area of 345 square miles.\n",
      "The chief industrial areas lie firstly, to the North-west, including Spandau, Siemenstadt, Wedding, Tegel, and Reinickendorf, and secondly, to the South and South-east including Marienfelde, Tempelhof, and Johannistal, There are other well-established industrial areas, such as Lichtenberg and SchBneberg, which are respectively in the eastern and southern quarters of the city.\n",
      "Further industrial extension is taking place in various outlying portions of the administrative area.\n",
      "The course of the river Spree, which is navigable, runs approximately from South-east to North-west through the centre of the city.\n",
      "At Spandau it joins the Havel, which flows from North to South along the western border of Berlin. The Teltow canal, which leaves the Spree near Treptow and runs through the Southern outskirts of Greater Berlin, Joins the Havel near Potsdam and forms a link to relieve the water-borne traffic through the centre of the city.\n",
      "Great use has been made of the waterways around Berlin in order to connect the capital with the Elbe and the Oder. Large inland harbours have been constructed. The most important of which is the Westhafen, where 70 large ships can be loaded simultaneously. The Westhafen is connected with the Spree and with the Havel, which it ''Joins at Spandau. From the Havel (North-west of Berlin) ship\n",
      "canals have been built giving direct access in the East to the Oder, and in the West to the Elbe. By this means navigable waterways connect Berlin directly with Stettin and the Baltic, and with Hamburg.\n",
      "The main railway artery between Western and North-eastern Europe runs through Berlin. There are three large railway stations (';on this East to West line. In addition main lines radiate from five\n",
      "other terminal railway stations to all parts of Germany. The local and suburban traffic is served by the electric Stadt- und Ringbahn, the extensive network of which extends over the whole area. This is supplemented by the large system of the Hoch- und Untergrundbahn, which runs partly underground and partly a3 an elevated railway, and ' by the tramway and bus services.\n",
      "All the leading firms have administrative offices in Berlin.\n",

On the East of the Rhine the country is much more thickly populated and rises eastwards to about 200 feet, except in the gap through which run the River Ruhr and the Rhine-Herne oanal. To the North and South are extensive forests.\n",

      "Duisburg owes its industrial inportanoe and prosperity to the presence, in its immediate vicinity, of hard coal in very considerable quantities. This has accounted for the development of iron and steel, heavy engineering, and other industries and brought about the necessity for construction and repeated expansion of the Duisburg-Ruhrort Harbour situated at the mouth of the river Ruhr.\n",
      "Duisburg's situation at the confluences of the rivers Rhine and Ruhr and in the centre of the western concentration of the Ruhr industrial area gives it great importance from the point of view of transportation. Its main olaim to fame is that it is here more than anywhere else in the Ruhr or Rhineland that the transfer of goods from rail to water or water to rail takes place, and it is this factor that has made Duisburg the greatest inland waterway harbour in Europe.\n",
      "The railway network at Duisburg has been constructed primarily to provide ample facilities to deal with the rail traffic originating from, or destined for the waterways} this function is fulfilled by the extensive marshalling yards at Ruhrort Helfen Neu Sohultenhof, which handled about 14 million tons of traffic annually before the w 'r. a second - and scarcely less important - funotion of the system is to aoocomodate the North-South and the West-East flow of land traffic; this is achieved by the marshalling yards at Duisburg main station, and, amongst others, these at Oberhausen Vest in the North-East (see under 'Oberhausen\"), at Wedau to the South-East, and at Hohenbudberg on the left bank of the river Rhine (see under \"Uerdingen\").\n",

There are two harbours to deal with the waterborne traffic, which oonsists in the main of coal, ooke, and finished iron aikl steel goods (outwards): iron-ore, grain and timber (inwards); the harbours are also important for storage reasons.\n",

The town's railway connection with Germany consists of a branch line from Singen which at Konstanz Joins the Swiss railway along the Southern shore of the lake. To the North Konstanz is cut off from the German shore by the North-western arm of the lake. The town extends into Switzerland and the frontier passes through the Southern suburbs. It is a health resort. The industries, which include book printing, textile fancy goods, and a few small chemical works, are unimportant, except for the works listed below.\n",

Before the war the works were known to be engaged on producing chemicals based on ethyl alcohol as the raw material: this is presumed to have now ceased. Wood distillation was one carried out on a considerable scale but, in view of the present unimportance of this product, production of it may have ceased. This remains, however, an important centre for developing chemical processes.\n",
